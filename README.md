# Time Series Forecasting of Traffic Flow Using SARIMA

This project applies a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast hourly traffic volume using historical sensor data from Californiaâ€™s freeway network.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal is to accurately forecast January 2017 traffic volume from Sensor 548 using two years of historical hourly data (2015â€“2016) provided by the California Department of Transportation's Performance Measurement System (PeMS). 

Key tasks included:
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Seasonal model configuration and evaluation
- Forecasting and residual diagnostics

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

The analysis followed a structured forecasting pipeline:

1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
   - Converted timestamps, handled missing/invalid entries  
   - Created time-based features (hour, weekday, holiday, season)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Identified daily and seasonal traffic patterns  
   - Validated temporal consistency using STL decomposition

3. **Modeling**  
   - Evaluated multiple SARIMA configurations  
   - Selected `SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,1)[24]` based on RMSE and residuals

4. **Forecasting**  
   - Trained on 2015â€“2016 data  
   - Forecasted January 2017 with confidence intervals

## âœ… Results

- **Best Model**: SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,1)[24]  
- **RMSE (Forecast)**: 0.01056  
- **MAE**: 0.00727  
- **Correlation**: 0.82  

The model successfully captured short-term fluctuations and strong daily seasonality, delivering accurate and stable forecasts.
